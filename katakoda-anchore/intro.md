In this scenario, we will see how Anchore scanner works, from installing to scanning docker images.

```Anchore Engine is a Docker container static analysis tool that automates the inspection, analysis, and evaluation of images. It then provides a policy evaluation result for each image: pass/fail.```

For more understanding, refer to [Documentation](https://engine.anchore.io/docs/) or [Github](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine).
